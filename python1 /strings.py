#Challenge - Journal Entry
journal = """Today I woke up at 8 AM. I took a shower 
and quickly got changed. Then I went to my high school for a tour since I just transferred there. I met two new people and one old friend. It was nice because we just talked for a long time and ate lunch. Then it was time for me to leave for EVIT. I walked to the front office and exited through there. I put on my EVIT shirt and waited 7 minutes for my bus to arrive. It took about 20 minutes to get to EVIT. When I arrived at EVIT, I sat down to take my spiral test, it was difficult. I got an 80% on my first try which was the goal. I want to try again tomorrow for a better score though"""
