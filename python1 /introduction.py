#Challenge - Happiest Moment
print("I don't really have a specific memory that I can call my happiest moment. All I know is that I'm happiest when I'm with my family or alone. Spending time with others is something I enjoy when I have the patience for it. I'm introverted in nature so I need time to recharge otherwise I'm quite irritable. I enjoy most activities so I have many happy memories.")
